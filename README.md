# Freedom or Security
Visualizing whether countries prefer freedom or security

Here I use World Value Survey dataset Wave 7 (WV7) to plot what countries citizens prefer more when confronted with the choice: security or freedom.
Respondents' answers are reported in percentage. See the written report here: https://stojkovics.github.io/freedom_vs_security.html
